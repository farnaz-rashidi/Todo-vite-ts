# Todo List

This is a simple Todo List application built with TypeScript and bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) using a vanilla-ts framework.
This project is based on the tutorial from [typescript-course by Dave Gary](https://github.com/gitdagray/typescript-course/tree/main/lesson11).

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

By default, the application will be available at http://localhost:5173.
